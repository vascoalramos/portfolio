Hello! I'm Vasco Ramos, a 23-year-old Junior Infrastructure Engineer located in Porto, Portugal, currently working at YData. My academic background is in Computer Science and Software Engineering, and I'm passionate about DevOps, Orchestration, Site Reliability Engineering, and Systems Architecture.

During my years as a student, I always tried to enrich my academic path with other activities such as volunteer work and associativism within the university. With that in mind, I was for three years a mentor to first-year students.

Furthermore, since my second year, I was part of an organization called <a href="http://aettua.pt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="AETTUA">AETTUA</a>, a non-profit youth association that aims to promote the most diverse activities for all students, teachers and employees of our department (<a href="https://www.ua.pt/deti" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="DETI">DETI</a>).

With this experience, I had the chance to organize workshops, trips to a bunch of companies' headquarters and job fairs. I consider this work one of the most important things I did during college because it allowed me to improve my social skills, such as teamwork and people management. Even today I take great joy in helping students and young engineers by giving talks and workshops on subjects such as Docker, CI/CD, and Kubernetes.

I'm also a huge fan of literature, music, and cinema. I love to read, and I'm always looking for new books to read, although my preference is for fantasy and science fiction.
